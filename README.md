## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I was not satisfied with the way that background positioning worked in this exercise. I thought that using percentages would have made it easier for the background circles to stay on the edges of the component card, but instead I had to manually identify and create a few responive breakpoints. Additionally, the background images move in relationship to the component card in between breakpoints.

For continued development, I would further research this so that the background was more fluid responsive.
